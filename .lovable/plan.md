## Fix: Missing Environment Configuration

### Problem
The application is showing a blank screen with the error **"supabaseUrl is required"** because the `.env` file containing the Supabase credentials doesn't exist in the project.

### Root Cause
The Lovable Cloud integration should automatically provide a `.env` file with:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`

This file is missing, causing the Supabase client to fail initialization.

### Solution
Create the `.env` file with the correct Lovable Cloud credentials that were provided in the system context:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="cguzpetufoftdqxwqygh"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNndXpwZXR1Zm9mdGRxeHdxeWdoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjQwMzQ5NzIsImV4cCI6MjA3OTYxMDk3Mn0.NYZpIbubLZxZRYrZaz6jw3etdLBSnZFN7OJQAx-FRzs"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://cguzpetufoftdqxwqygh.supabase.co"
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create the `.env` file with the Supabase credentials from the Lovable Cloud connection
2. The application will automatically pick up the environment variables and initialize the Supabase client correctly

### Expected Outcome
- The blank screen error will be resolved
- The Supabase client will initialize successfully
- All database, authentication, and edge function features will work as expected

**Technical Note**: The `.env` file is normally auto-generated by Lovable Cloud. This appears to be a sync issue where the file was not properly created or was accidentally removed.
